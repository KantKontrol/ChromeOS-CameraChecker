## Description
This repo contains a Chrome Application. This app allows the user to check both camera and microphone on a Chromebook device, without logging on. This app is meant to be provisioned through Google Admin Console. Very simple and very useful, for computer technicians like myself.

## Installation
Installation on a non chrome os device is as simple as opening "appilication.html". This item was submitted for review via Google's developer dashboard for the Chrome Web Store.
